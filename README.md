## About the project
Studying is hard, but when you can make a game to help it makes it easier! So thats what I did! This project is a Javascript quiz coded using Javascript!
A little bit much if you ask me haha. This project was a doozy! I used all of my Javascript knowledge and then some. I learned some new DOM manipulation techniques like the classlist.add and .remove functions.
I experimented with the forEach function as well and a few others I probably blocked out from memory.

This project had a few stumbles in it for me. I learned that sometimes it is easier to just set the display to none or block if you want an element to appear and disappear. I also learned a valuable lesson in controlling timers, my score mechanic
was having some major issues and the timers were not helping. But the most important thing I learned was the power of the console.log. I must have used console.log over 100 times debugging this program.

Although it was a tough project I grew as a web developer and I am excited for more!
